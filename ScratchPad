#description: Adds user assigned to personal desktop to local Administrators group on session host VM based on device join type.
#execution mode: Combined
#tags: Nerdio
<#
Notes:
This script checks if the device is Hybrid Azure AD Joined or Entra ID Joined.
If Hybrid, it adds the AD user to the local Administrators group.
If Entra ID Joined, it adds the Azure AD user to the local Administrators group.
It also checks if the user is already a local admin before attempting to add them.
Ensure $DesktopUser is provided in UPN format (e.g., user@contoso.com) for Entra ID joined devices.
